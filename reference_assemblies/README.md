This directory contains references assemblies for each of the genomes used in this study. They assembled using Trycycler followed by Illumina polishing (using various tools) and manual curation. They should be completely error-free.

The _Escherichia coli_ genome contains some structural heterogeneity in its largest plasmid, so there are two valid ways to assemble this genome. `ATCC_25922_Escherichia_coli.fasta.gz` contains the main reference assembly and `ATCC_25922_Escherichia_coli_alt.fasta.gz` contains the other structural variant in that plasmid.

Similarly, the Vibrio cholerae_ genome contains some structural heterogeneity in its largest chromosome, so there are two valid ways to assemble this genome. `ATCC_14035_Vibrio_cholerae.fasta.gz` contains the main reference assembly and `ATCC_14035_Vibrio_cholerae_alt.fasta.gz` contains the other structural variant in that chromosome.
